<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Trinity is a liberal arts university with a current student enrollment of about 2,600 students. Trinity offers 49 majors and has a student to faculty ration of 9:1. Trinity University is celebrating its 150th anniversary. For the class of 2019, the acceptance rate when down from around 40% to 29%  </p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="murchison.jpg" style="width:300px;height:200px"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has a beautiful campus. Sharing this beautiful space are the Trinicats. Trinicats are the university sponsored cats that roam the campus and become friends of the students. Located on uppercampus next to Northrup Hall is Miller fountain. Miller fountain is home to many traditions on campus. Whenever students celebrate their birthday, they are to be dunked in the foundtian by their peers. Another highlight of Trinity's campus is the Murchinson Tower. All first year students climb the tower beginning their journey at Trinity. The next time Trinity students will climb the tower is on their graduation day. </p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the people that I have met. So far, the Trinity community feels like a tighter group of students where it is difficult for individuals to go unnoticed. Another thing I appreciate about Trinity is the faculty. So far, they have been more accomodating than professors I would have found at larger state schools. I also appreciate the opportunities Trinity offers for students to get involved around campus. For such a small university, it would surprise me if somebody did not find a club or an assocaition that met their interests outside of their classwork.</p>
<p>I chose Trinity University because of the liberal arts circiculum. Going into college, I did not have my heart completely set on an academic path I wanted to persue, so the liberal arts ciriculum will keep my options a open for a bit longer than a typical state school. This also gives me an opportunity to take classes that I normally would not have taken if I went to a traditional university. Another reason why I chose to attend Trinity was because, in high school, I was involved in the fine arts trhough schoir and musical theatre. Here at Trinity, non-music or non-theatre majors are not restricted from participating or auditioning in the ensembles or main stage productions.</p>
<p>I hope to/ am thinking of majoring in Political Science because I am ambitiously planning on attending law school. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
